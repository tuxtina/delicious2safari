<h2>Using delicious2safari</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<ol id="graybox">
<li>Enter your del.icio.us login and password</li>
<li>Adjust download settings (optional)</li>
<li>Start the download</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> Even though delicious2safari takes great care when updating
your Safari bookmarks, there might be a situation where you would like to restore your old Safari bookmarks. delicious2safari always creates a backup of your Safari bookmarks in 
Library/Application Support/delicious2safari in your home directory.
</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>
You can choose where to put your del.icio.us bookmarks in Safari's bookmark hierarchy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Bookmarks</b> (default):
del.icio.us bookmarks will be placed in a folder named "del.icio.us" in the top-most level 
of your Safari bookmarks. To see or edit those bookmarks, choose "Show All Bookmarks" from
Safari's bookmark menu.
</li>
<li>
<b>Bookmarks Menu:</b>
del.icio.us bookmarks will be placed in a folder named "del.icio.us" in your Safari 
bookmarks menu.
</li>
<li>
<b>Bookmarks Bar:</b>
del.icio.us bookmarks will be placed in a folder named "del.icio.us" in your Safari 
bookmarks bar.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If there are folders named "del.icio.us" in your chosen destination, you 
will be asked if you want to replace them (it is possible to have more 
than one folder with the same name in Safari). You can also set 
delicious2safari to always replace existing folders by checking 
<b>Don't ask before replacing folders</b>.
</p>
<p>
By default, your del.icio.us bookmarks will be downloaded as one flat list 
of bookmarks. If you want to have your del.icio.us
bookmarks organized into subfolders according to their associated tags,
check the <b>Organize bookmarks according to tags</b> option. This will 
slightly increase the time needed to process the downloaded bookmarks, 
depending on how many tags are associated with each bookmarks, and how many 
bookmarks you have.</p>
